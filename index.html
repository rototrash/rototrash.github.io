        <h3>About Me I guess</h3>
        Well, I'm a Computer and Linux Enthusiast and a 3D hobbyist/artist from India currently in 12th grade. I mostly enjoy ricing my system and doing stuff in blender in my free time (which I haven't been getting a lot lately). I'm also learning some Python, C++ and OpenGL API (which is very cool btw). Other than that I love listening to Low Roar's calm music.

        I use <strong>ArcoLinux</strong> as my daily driver with <strong>i3</strong> as my window manager. You can find my dotfiles on my GitHub ^_^

        CSS maybe janky, I made this webite in about 2 hours after watching some hour long crash-courses on HTML5 and CSS by Traversy Media. I originally wanted to learn CSS just to configure Rofi.
